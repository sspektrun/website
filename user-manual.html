                        <p>If Spektrun doesn't open or ALWAYS crash at the start, maybe you're not meeting the requirements, please, check the <a href="about.html">requirements page</a>  before installing Spektrun</p>
                        <p>In the case that you fullfill the requirements, and the app keeps stopping / doesn't launch, maybe can be produced by an unknown error. In a near future, Spekrtun will have a bug-report section</p>

                        <p>Revisit the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads page</a> and install the latest version. You may need to uninstall the old version first to avoid conflicts.</p>

                        <div class="dropdown-content">
                          <p>Spektrun it's a very very recent app, the app it's being developed at the moment, so, maybe, some aspects have not been fixed yet.</p>
                          <p>If your Spektrun app instance have crash, maybe has been due to your internet connection, or your vinculation with your own Spotify account. So, make sure to be always connected to Internet to avoid unknown errors, and also, make sure that you're login with your Spotify account</p>
                          <p>Theese well-known errors will be fixed in a near future.</p>

                          <p>At the moment, Spektrun's usage are only via invitation. In other words, if you're not in the whitelist you're not going to be able to use Spektrun.</p>
                          <p>In case you somehow access to the rest of the content from Spektrun, Spektrun has a banlist function that can ban a not-wished account from the app at any moment.</p>
                        
                          <p>Due to Spektrun's logic and legal terms, Spektrun maybe it's not going to quit the whitelist at any moment.</p>
                          <p>So, if you're planning to use Spektrun, make sure that you're in the whitelist, because, in other words, the .apk package you'll install will be useless</p>

                          <p>Currently, in the version V.1.8.1 of Spektrun this it's allowed, but this feature it's going to be removed in the posterior versions to improve the security of the ban / whitelist system.</p>

                          <p>Yes, the app itself it's only private use, was made due to educational purposes and also, the creator (ACV) doesn't gain any penny with this application.<br>ACV doesn't want the app to be available to the public or be commercial at any point, so the app it's "legal".</p>

                          <p>There are some parts of the app that only works with Internet connection, and in the case the user doesn't have that the app crashes. This it's a well now bug that will be fixed in very later updates. In the update 1.9.0 this bug it's going to be also, so, we're sorry for the inconvenences. </p>
